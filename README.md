**THE TL'DR** *It's better to do a little consistently every day, even if you don't see the immediate benefits right away.*

### THE IDEAL READER
A recent college or Bootcamp graduate seeking their first dev role, and who doesn’t yet have an internship or apprenticeship, which are two excellent opportunities that will give you all the below skills.

### THE GOAL OF THIS SCHEDULE
Do these five tasks every weekday in any order you want.

### “DO YOU HAVE TO DO THESE ALL EXACTLY AS WRITTEN?”
Nope. However, I found that these overall “themes” helped me plan out each day with activities that actually helped me in the job hunt, instead of spending hours sending out a million applications each day into the void.

### “HOW LONG SHOULD THESE TAKE?”
Each task should take at most 50 minutes, with at least a 1-hour break in-between tasks, a trick that I learned from Nick Bull (more on Bull below). I usually spent these breaks napping, reading, cooking, cleaning, running errands, hanging out with family or friends, and more; anything that got me away from my computer.

### “SWEET, I’LL DO THIS SCHEDULE EVERY SINGLE DAY AND EVERYTHING WILL BE GOOD”
Wait a minute. If you’re feeling ambitious, you could maybe do this during a free Saturday or Sunday as well. However, do NOT do this EVERY single day. Pick one day of the week where you don’t do any code or job hunting. (I picked Saturdays.) Having one day to recharge and step away from this very stressful work will only do your brain good. You’re not being lazy by taking a rest day.

### A NOTE ABOUT SETTING EXPECTATIONS
You know your goals, abilities, and limitations better than anyone. Some people have the means and resources to take their time with the job hunt. You may have a family to take care of, or you may have to work a temporary or side job to pay the bills while you look for the job you’ve been training for. Yes, you will see less qualified programmers get jobs quicker than you. No, it doesn’t get any easier seeing those “SOME ~PERSONAL~ NEWS” LinkedIn posts when you still don’t have a job. No, this doesn’t mean you’re not qualified to get a job. Other people’s success is not your failure.

This schedule worked best for me, but it’s most important to be inspired to create the schedule that works best for YOU. The job hunt is more of an art than a science, and it’ll involve a lot of trial-by-error. It’ll also take time. You might not see the benefits of what you do one day until maybe a week, a month, a season, or even a year later. It took me 8 months after I graduated from my 12-week full-time bootcamp to get my first full-time salaried offer. I signed my offer almost a year to the date after I put in my 2-weeks of my last full-time job to pursue software engineering. There was no single thing I did that turned me from a total beginner into a qualified applicant overnight. It was the cultivation of staying consistently devoted to practicing and learning, rolling with the many highs and (many more) lows, and knowing when to step away. It took me 8 months, but I do believe that if I had this schedule from the start, I would have either found a job quicker, or I would have saved myself a few periods of depression and a lot of stress. Focus on creating fruitful and meaningful individual days, and you’ll be surprised by how quickly and strong your garden of knowledge will grow. As the saying goes: chance favors the prepared mind. Here’s another saying I like, via Annie Dillard: How we spend our days is how we spend our lives.

## THE SCHEDULE
## APPLY (50 minutes)
*Networking for people who hate networking*

Networking can feel gross and unnatural, especially for us introverts. It’s also 100% necessary. I wish it wasn’t. However, the right people aren’t going to pluck us out of obscurity and base our value just on the quality of our work. People get jobs for many different reasons, many of which are beyond our control and some of which remain mysteries to us (and sometimes even to the people who hire us). The one thing you CAN control is how you grow and treat your network and support system.

Every weekday, **submit at least 1 new job application**; **send 1 cold email/LinkedIn message** to a senior software engineer whom you admire and wish to learn more about how they got into their role; **attend 1 networking event**; or **complete 1 part of the interview process**(the initial phoner, a live coding challenge, etc). Even spending these 50 minutes researching the company and writing out potential questions is a good use of time. You can do all the above in one day too if you’re feeling bold. At the very least, just aim to do one of these things.

Some engineers and recruiters will recommend that you send 40+ applications a week. If you can do that, go for it; I had friends who did this and succeeded. However, from the past year of trial and error, I found that a few very thoughtful and intentional applications and connections were more helpful than a million quick applications thrown into the void. It was because of my network and personal connections that I landed my first production environment Agile-team work (Patrick!), my first paid work as an engineer (Sophia!), and my first full-time job offer (Patrick, again!) all of whom I kept in touch with throughout the past year, even just to check in and gossip about how amazing Kevin Bacon is. Don’t just reach out to people only when you need someone; check in on them, too.
* **ACTION STEP #1**: Before you do any networking, make sure your **LinkedIn** profile is ace. (Here’s [mine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brady-gerber/).) Two books I also recommend to help with using LinkedIn are Steve Dalton’s [The 2-Hour Job Search](https://2hourjobsearch.com/) and Nick Bull’s [Win The Interview Game](https://wintheinterviewgame.com/).

## PRACTICE (50 minutes)
*Make the eventual technical challenge a breeze … or at least less of a pain*

**Complete 1 coding challenge** that either tests what you already know or teaches you new ways to solve problems that you’ll eventually see during an interview coding challenge. Some people prefer LeetCode, but I found [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/) to be easier to use, and it was where I consistently ran into the most problems that I would see in real-life interviews. To make your life easier, create a private repo where you can save all the challenges you practiced and eventually complete for interviews for later review and refactoring. Did you complete your challenge in less than 50 minutes? Do it again! And remember: the majority of these companies are not expecting you to solve the problem. They are testing to see how you handle difficult questions and problem-solving on the spot. Do you freeze up and don’t talk? Do you first ask questions to clarify the problem and try to make a plan? Do you ask if you’re allowed to Google, or make clear what resources are available to you? Do you dive in right away and hope for the best? Anyone can learn syntax; the goal is to prove that you can learn.
* **ACTION STEP #1**: Before you even start CodeSignal, the three beginner problems you NEED to first master in your language of choice are **Palindrome**, **FizzBuzz**, and **Fibonacci**. If you can solve these three problems without referring to any notes or Google and can articulate your logic and thought-process out loud in under 15min, you’re already ahead of the pack.

## STUDY (50 minutes)
*Give your future self a break*

Create a new Google Doc (or Notion, or whatever note-taking device you prefer) where you can keep all your notes in one place, and **fill out 1 page with whatever topic you want to learn**: reread your class notes, read new articles, watch YouTube videos or anything else that teaches you something new. It’s best to focus on one specific topic a day or create a theme for the week (i.e. spend a week following a YouTube series that breaks down everything you need to know about React Hooks). Did you bomb a technical challenge because you didn’t understand JavaScript Promises? There’s your next topic! Create the ultimate reference that is tailored specifically to you and how you like to organize your thoughts, and when you run into technical challenges that’ll allow you to Google and refer to notes, you’ll be ready.

If you don't know where to start, here are some topics to get you started (as someone with a full-stack software engineer background who mostly enjoys the front-end and works in vanilla JS, React, and Python):
* HTML
  * Basic HTML structures & Attributes
  * Semantic HTML
  * Know how to build input fields & tables
* CSS
  * Flexbox
  * CSS Grid
  * Responsive design & media queries
  * Basics of Bootstrap and Material UI
  * Custom properties
  * Working with SVGs
  * Pretty much every topic covered in [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/guides/)
* JavaScript
  * Variables (know the difference between var, const, and let)
  * Scope, hoisting & closures ("this")
  * Data types (number, string, boolean, null, undefined, etc)
  * Operators & Expressions
  * Objects & OOP
  * Arrays & important array methods (ex. Map and Filter)
  * Functions & knowing the differences between callback functions, higher-order functions, function declaration, function expression, and arrow functions
  * Know how to build a Hashmap/Hashtable from scratch
  * Conditional statements (if, ternary, switch)
  * Loop statements (for, for of, for in, while, do while)
  * DOM events & manipulation
  * Promises and Async & Await
  * JSON
  * REST APIs, HTTP routing, and making API calls (fetch, axios)
  * Using `setTimeout` and `setInterval` together
  * RegEx
  * Testing (ex. Jest)
  * Modules (exporting and importing)
  * Basic JS Security theory (XSS & CSRF)
  * jQuery
    * Some engineers will roll their eyes at this, but in the real world, I still encounter many websites that still rely on it; it's good to spend at least one day knowing the basics.
* I also have notes for **React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, how to "Hello, World" with the MERN-stack, TypeScript, Python, Django, Go, SQL (Postgres & MySQL), AWS, Accessibility, UX design**, and more.
* **ACTION STEP #1**: Whenever I’m starting a new topic, I usually start with a solid YouTube series where I follow along with the code in a new study repo. My two favorite YouTube coding tutorial channels are [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia) and [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified). A lot of people also like [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja) and [Programming with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/c/programmingwithmosh).

## CODE (50 minutes)
*Keep your GitHub green*

**Create 1 GitHub green square**. You can do this in a few ways: Refactor your old deployed projects, create and work on new repos (public or private), contribute to open source and make pull requests, and more. GitHub allows you to pin any six repos on your profile, so work on making sure those six pinned repos are projects that you’re really proud of and can talk about during interviews. Here’s one way to approach these six repos (thank you, Howie, for this tip):
1. **A creative app that shows off the tech stack you wish to get paid to do**. If you're applying for React jobs, build something in React that demonstrates your understanding of state, hooks, and all the things that you can do in React that you can’t do in vanilla JS. No matter your tools or frameworks, including some type of Testing. (What I built: a React-built study guide teaching Big O, algorithms, and data structures through The Simpsons.)
2. **A working app that conveys your understanding of databases and APIs and which creates real-life business value**. For example, build a calendar app with the PERN-stack and include some type of Auth, Testing, and AWS functionality. If you share this app with your grandparents, would they be able to understand what it is and how to use it?
3. **A clone of a popular app that proves that you can recreate something that a lot of people like to use**. And THEN add your own personal spin and improvements. (What I built: a minimalist Spotify clone that prints off lyrics while you listen to a song.)
4. **A functional app using some kind of object-oriented language**: Python, Go, Java, C++, etc. Even if you’re a front-end or full-stack engineer focusing on JavaScript, it’s good to show that you also can work with other kinds of languages. Keep it clean and simple, just show off the fundamentals.
5. **A shared, open-source repo that encourages collaboration**. Either through your internship, apprenticeship, hackathon, or open source collaborations with other people. This will force you to work with other people, and it’s a great way to practice contributing to open-source and making pull requests on GitHub. For example, you could start a repo with your Bootcamp class where everyone contributes one terrible animal pun in one expanding README file; keep it simple and engaging.
6. **Whatever you want!** If the five previous ideas sound boring, first make something that you’ve always wanted to make and that you would be proud to share. It’s a lot easier to code something when you … actually want to code it. It also shows that you actually enjoy programming and that you’re not doing this just for the money.
* **ACTION STEP #1**: And an easy way to get started with all of this: Create a [personal GitHub README](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) (here’s [mine](https://github.com/bg-write)).

## EXERCISE (50 minutes)
*Get away from the computer*

Seriously, take care of your body. **Do 1 type of exercise or activity that raises your heart rate**. This is so important that it deserves to be its own task. Even if you only have time to walk for 45 minutes, that’s enough. If you don’t live in an area that’s great for walking or going outside often, walk around your living space, do home workouts, stretch throughout the day, or whatever you can do. And [make sure your work space is built to work with, not against, your body](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8_ME4VwTiw).
* **ACTION STEP #1**: My go-to workout when I’m strapped for time is this [15-min HIIT workout](https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/15-minute-full-body-hiit-workout-no-equipment-required-ncna977711) (no equipment needed). I also do this [10-min morning yoga exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pKly2JojMw) every morning.

## LAST NOTE
You are not your work. The job hunt is hard.
